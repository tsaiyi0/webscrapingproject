COMFORT KIT FOR RADIATION AND CHEMO PILL,GOTHOPE,2024-10-21T15:44:34+00:00,"Hello Everyone.  Was hoping to receive some responses to my 'Radiation for Brain Cancer' post.  But I understand there are a multitude of questions and difficult to help everyone.  In the meantime, can anyone suggest some things for a care package for my sister-in-law?  I'm a cancer survivor myself, and I'm familiar with some things I can give her that might help in the journey:  mints, head cap, socks, something to read or word puzzles, gum, sea band for nausea, skin lotions and creams, etc.  Any other suggestions for those of you that have dealt with this will be most appreciated.  Thank you, and God Bless all of you.  Sending prayers. üôè"
RADIATION FOR BRAIN CANCER,GOTHOPE,2024-10-13T14:15:19+00:00,"Hello to all of you Survivors out there!  I began my blog back in 2000 with OVCA, and continued through 2006 with another bout with OVCA and in 2013 with breast cancer.  This forum is invaluable for information, support and making new friends.  And now I have some questions regarding my sister-in-law who is dealing with stage 4 brain cancer. I'm sorry to say I do not have a formal diagnosis.  So I only have the following to provide:  This has been over a span of about 2 months.  Had a siezure and it was discovered she had a tumor on the brain.  Over the next couple of months, after tests and consults with the Mayo Clinic (my husband's brother and sister-in-law are in North Dakota), it had progressed even further in a short period of time and now the one tumor became three.  On Friday she had surgery in Minnesota and they removed all the tumors.  The doctor said had they not operated, she would have had only 4-5 weeks to live.  The doctor still says to hold on to hope, but in 50 causes the average is only 1 that goes into remission.They will head home this week, and she will go into a rehab facility for a while.  Then they plan on starting radiation in 4 weeks.  There is a small spot on her thyroid, which they said is not critical at this point.  Something on her spleen, which has not been identified.  And there was a cyst on her kidney which was biopsied and is benign.My questions:  If she chooses to have radiation, what can we send to her to make her more comfortable and able to get through this.  My 'care kit' for patients has included things like warm socks, mints, head covering of some kind, word puzzles, books, etc.  I assume brain radiation is going to cause more side affects than my breast cancer radiation did.More importantly, I would love to hear from those of you who maybe have chosen a different method of treatment, or maybe none at all?  Please give me your success stories, methods of treatment, and if any of you were stage 4.  I would like to give them plenty of options, as I come from a position of 'explore ALL options'.   That includes homeopathic, holistic, etc.  I really dread her having to do the radiation, as I know how it works and I don't see that it will prolong her life, maybe even make her more miserable and affected (siezures, eye sight, etc.) than is worth doing.  Any advice, suggestions, experiences will be most appreciated.  Again, thank you everyone.  And I pray that your journeys are sustainable and hopeful and miraculous!"

Emotional support for 21yr old w. upcoming occipital temporal tumor surgery,KLJ57,2024-07-09T02:54:06+00:00,"Hello, my niece has a tumor on her occipital lobe causing seizures.  She is scheduled for surgery the last week this month (July 2024) at MGH Brigham.  MRI today indicates tumor has grown 1cm since MRI in April.   She is a very level headed and mature person, and was ready to go forward with the surgery, but the latest MRI results have caused her to become apprehensive.Looking for a support group or individual who has had similar surgery and might help me with understanding the process and help her deal with the natural fear and trepidation.  Online or in person, would love to hear from a fellow survivor.  ACS survivors helped me so much when I was diagnosed and treated with stage 3 breast cancer in the year 2000.   Thanks in advance."

Sensory Seizures after brain cancer surgery,monica_larosa,2024-06-08T05:20:52+00:00,"my husband had a GBM almost kill him now 2.5 years ago. He did 7 weeks chemo/radiation, they resected 80% in the hospital the day he almost died, and 1 year of TMZ. It was on the right side of his brain only. His scans have all been normal since that terrible day thank God, but he is having these random episodes of numbness and tingling in his hand, then goes to his face, then his legs for about 20 minutes and then he's back to normal. The first time he had an episode was about a year ago. I thought he was having a seizure or stroke so he went to the ER. Everything turned out great, the ER doc said it could be a small seizure or random nerve misfiring because his brain is still healing etc and to see a neurologist. Our neurologist said it was something called a sensory seizure and said if it happens again he would take away his driver's license and he can't work again for 6 months. During the episodes, my husband maintains full awareness and can move freely when it's happening which makes me question why it's even considered a seizure‚Ä¶. I'm an RN and I have never learned or heard of this until now. I've heard other doctors say it sounds like paresthesia from chemo/radiation or nerve healing.  Has anyone experienced this post-craniotomy/brain cancer? My husband went literally a year without driving or working after everything happened and it was soooo bad for him mentally‚Ä¶he is sooo happy to be back at work and he's getting the job he actually has always wanted now. We're just not sure what to do though with these episodes because of his safety and if they are really seizures, I'm concerned they are getting worse. I would love to tell his neurologist, but he would take everything away from my husband again which is so frustrating because he is not limited during them, confused, staring off, etc anything classified as what I know as a seizure."

I am a Grade 3 Anaplastic Ependymoma Survivor: Survivorship Story,btg_bri,2022-11-10T07:48:16+00:00,"Hello. I learned about this group during my most recent clinic visit. I want to connect with others who have undergone or can relate to my treatment story.In 2016 I turned 18 years old. Three weeks later I was diagnosed with a Grade 3 Anaplastic Ependymoma. I had attributed 6 months worth of daily headaches to being a senior in high school. Shortly following graduation, I learned the headaches were being caused by a brain tumor.The treatment plan was surgery, chemotherapy, & (proton) radiation therapy. I am fortunate to say surgery was successful with resecting the tumor; the surgeon felt strongly he was able to remove all of the tumor. The removal of the tumor would reduce the odds of tumor regrowth to 30%. The additional chemotherapy and radiation would further reduce the likelihood for regrowth to 20%.When I woke up I could not move the full right side of my body, nor could I feel anything on the right side. I had lost 50% of my vision. I could not read (part of this was aphasia, part of this was caused by the visual field cut).I spent a month at a medical rehabilitation facility. Through intense therapies, I regained my ability to walk with the support of a crutch. I began chemotherapy following my discharge from the hospital. I am fortunate to have only undergone two rounds of chemotherapy. I was hospitalized several times during treatment as a result of low blood cell counts that resulted in fevers. I also broke out with a rash that covered my back and abdomen (the oncologist was not sure why the rash was occurring, but I have my suspicions it was the chemo...).The most difficult part of chemotherapy treatment for me was losing my hair. Something as seemingly insufficient as hair loss had a huge impact on my mental health and perception of self. Up to that point, I had maintained a positive attitude regardless of the major life changes I was facing. The thing about hair loss is that it is visible. At first, I believed that perhaps not all of my hair would fall out. After 3 weeks of chemotherapy, I noticed I was losing a large amount of hair whenever I brushed or combed it. Within a week, it was to the point where there were patches where hair was missing throughout my head.¬† My mother's friend shaved my head later that week. I cried as it was being done. In reality, this was difficult for me because I was accepting the fact that what I had been going through and what I was going through was actually happening. I was sick, and people were going to know I was sick.¬† They could now see the 6"" of stitches on my bald head.I wore a knit hat for the next 8 months.I underwent chemotherapy treatment for 2 months. Shortly afterwards, I began proton radiation therapy. Proton radiation is a type of concentrated therapy that does not go beyond the targeted area/tissue. This treatment was intense; I received treatment 5 days a week for 6 weeks. It involved an 1 & 1/2 to 2 & 1/2 hour drive to and from the treatment facility. I experience high rates of fatigue within the first week of starting treatment. A plastic mask molded to fit my entire head was placed over my head to keep me from moving my head. Radiation, though the sessions only averaged 20 minutes or so, was the most difficult part of treatment for me.At this point in my treatment journey, it had been 5 months. My 3 month MRI scan showed there was residual radiation, but the tumor no longer existed. The treatment plan included a 3rd round of chemotherapy, one my family and I ultimately decided not to undergo. My treatment was part of a trial, and there was no subanal evidence to show it would increase or decrease the chances of regrowth.I spent 1 year in outpatient speech therapy, 6 months with outpatient occupational therapy, and two years receiving outpatient physical therapy treatment. In 2017, one year following the beginning of my cancer treatments, I enrolled in classes at a community college. I had a delayed reading ability, but with accommodations I was managing classes and coursework well.The first year following the surgery I had MRI's every 3 months. In 2018 the MRI's were moved to every 6 months, which remained the status until 2020. The highest rate of regrowth for Grade 3 Anaplastic Ependymomas occurs in the first 2 years. The next goal became hitting the 5 year mark.During the time I underwent treatments in 2016, myself and my family were connected with a family undergoing nearly identical experiences medically. The patient was 18 at the time of their surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation treatments. Our mothers connected well, and it was nice to connect with someone undergoing similar circumstances. This person and I did not talk much following treatment; we kept tabs via social media.I had finally reached a place during 2019 where I was no longer afraid of MRI results or random headaches I would get.In 2021, I was a few months away from reaching the 5 year milestone. My mom called one day with devastating news; the individual I met during treatment had passed away. This news triggered all of my medical trauma, all of my fears. I never thought this person or I would die as a result of cancer. We were beating the odds, because for a long time, we were.For months, I struggled with feelings of survivor's guilt. I stopped functioning for a month. I was constantly comparing myself and my achievements to this individual's. I still do.It's 2022 and I am 24 years old.¬† I am a senior in college; I am studying to be a Social Worker. I want to work within hospitals and medical facilities helping patients and their families cope with medical trauma/life changes.I am struggling to cope with feelings of not being good enough. There are so many lives lost to cancer. There are people who fought harder and longer than myself. There's often the thought in the back of my mind ""Why did I survive when so many people do not?"".My medical trauma is deep, I am working to manage it with therapy. Some days are harder than others. I am grateful to be alive, I am grateful for the ability I do have, and I am grateful for my family and the unconditional support they offer. The next milestone is to reach ""10 years cancer free"".My current challenge is trying to find the courage to visit the person's grave. I believe this is an important step in my healing journey.I know this story is long, I appreciate it if you have read this far. I hope this might be helpful to someone maybe one day. Learning you have cancer is terrifying because there is so much in the future that remains unknown/uncertain. Cancer takes so much from those it affects. It's important to have a strong support system by your side throughout the process.Best wishes,btg_bri"
High grade brain tumor treatment side effects,Deb483,2021-10-08T18:39:21+00:00,"Hello. My husband had a partial resection of his brain tumor and radiation 10 years ago. It was a low grade Glioma at that time. For the past 10 years we have just monitored with MRI's. ¬†Minor growth until recently.

He is starting 6 weeks of radiation again but adding temodar at the same time. Then will do another 6 months of temodar. Has anyone done this treatment plan and if so was it successful at all.

Juvenile Pilocytic Astrocytoma Recurrence - Starting Chemo,JBall3,2019-09-01T05:08:44+00:00,"Hello - My 3 year old grandson was recently diagnosed with a JPA in December 2018. The surgeon was able to resect what she felt was 100% of the tumor. 10 months later, the MRI show a recurrence of the tumor and his¬† oncologist wants to immediately put him on a chemo regimen of Carboplatin and Vincristine. We were told that these two drugs are a first line of defense in childhood tumors. They also carry with them the common side effects of chemo, including, in rare cases, hearing loss and possible secondary cancer. This is a benign grade 1 tumor.¬† Due to the location which is on the brain stem, the oncologist does not want to start immediately to avoid any symptoms of the tumor since its not causing any at this time.¬† It is pure agony giving my otherwise healthy grandkid a year's worth of chemotherapy. I'd really like to hear from someone who has gone through something similar. I'm interested in hearing from parents/patients that went through this regimen.
