Still confused about Creatinine and GFR,MikeK703,2011-06-30T18:52:10+00:00,"This is a quote from the National Kidney Foundation website in answer to a question from somebody whose creatinine level was 1.58:""A creatinine level of 1.58 may be normal after removal of one kidney, especially if you are over 50 years of age. Removing one kidney always results in a decrease in total kidney function and an elevation in the creatinine test.""  Notice the ""always.""From MedicineNet.com:""A person with only one kidney may have a normal level of about 1.8 or 1.9."" Notice the ""normal.""My levels were normal before my radical nephrectomy and went bad immediately afterwards.  The above statements pretty much jibe with what my urologist told me -- that my creatinine readings (currently 1.5) and GFR readings (currently 47) are normal for somebody with one kidney.  Yet my nephrologist tells me I have chronic kidney disease (CKD), Stage 3. He is not ""alarmed"" but of course I am.  I told the nephrologist what my urologist said and what I had read online and he said, ""oh yes, that's true.""  But he still diagnosed me as having CKD and has ordered more blood tests at the end of July, which I don't have a problem with.  As a matter of fact, I like being monitored this closely.  But of course, I am confused.  I plan to discuss this with my urologist in my second followup visit in August.Thank you, Iceman, for sharing your results in my previous posting but I'd like to know how others' blood tests have gone since their surgeries.  If you don't mind, may I ask who else has had high creatinine/low GFR readings?  And if so, have you been told you have ""chronic kidney disease?"" Or have you been told that this is normal for your situation and nothing really to worry about?Thanks.Mike"
Complex Renal Cyst,Melanna,2024-10-22T14:22:01+00:00,"Hello All,I found this board a couple months ago when my dad was suddenly diagnosed with a mass on his kidney the size of a baseball. He had a nephrectomy and has been doing well since (pathology was RCC). I have been working to take care of my own body to ensure that if he ever needed a kidney, I would have one to spare. Well, after a recent ultrasound of my abdomen, it seems I have a multiloculated multiseptated cystic structure in the lower pole of the left kidney. It’s about 4x4x4. I’m in my 30’s, so a bit of a shock. I have a CT scheduled in two days, so now just a waiting game. Reading all of your experiences has been so helpful! What a great board for information and support! Thank you! ☺️"

Biggest incision swells,paulaf62,2024-11-10T15:45:09+00:00,"hi all,Had a partial nephrectomy 10/23, RCC clear stage 2, feeling pretty good at almost 3 weeks post op,  my concern in that my largest incision, one right below my left ribcage swells when I eat. I realize it’s right where my stomach and transverse colon is, could that be why?  Should I be concerned?  Anyone else have this? 
i see a lot of post from years ago, hope this board is still open"
Translocation RCC,nammu177,2024-10-26T15:38:32+00:00,"Hi all, My younger brother ( 33 yo) was recently diagnosed with a 20cm left kidney mass after having a cough for two months and then suddenly night sweats and weight loss in Sept 2024, underwent left open radical nephrectomy. The pathology report showed mixed cell types and spread to nearby lymph nodes. After 4 weeks another CT chest shows a new small growth in a supraclavicular lymph node and the biopsy was positive and last week they confirmed it was translocation RCC. He will be getting a combo immunotherapy treatment and I’m really hoping it responds. I wanted to see if anyone out there with similar experiences and how you were treated if stage 4 cancer  and recommendations for cancer centers for a second opinion especially this is a rare subtype . I tried to call MD Anderson and Memorial Sloan but they will not do telehealth for patients in CA. His current doctor seems to be great but because this is rare, I feel another opinion would help or if both docs can collaborate. Thank you!"
My experience after having a Laparoscopic  Partial Nephrectomy,sunny1234,2023-11-16T15:35:19+00:00,"I had my surgery 2weeks ago. This is what i experienced, Remember we are all different.On day one was stay was in hospital day 2 went home. Wow pain for the first few days was pretty ripe no laughing deep breathing coughing sneezing or yawning. My Shoulders hurt.  Did not really eat the first few day slowly started to eat no appetite in the first week, i have only just recently started to eat normal.  On day three i was able to just take Tylenol for my pain during the day as it slowly got better. I went for a 1/4 mile walk  i was very tired afterward.    For 4 nights at bedtime  i would take the pain med so i could sleep.  Day five i stopped night time pain med do to no bowel movement I only took Tylenol.   I Was taking Colace from day one, I added Miralax on day 3 took me almost 8 days before i moved my bowels.  Everyday i get a little better but my energy, being able to move quickly is only at 60% .  I still get tired after my walks and doing to many things.  On day 6 oh boy the itching began it got so bad that i had to take Benedryl every three hours for about 4 days. I still take benedryl but not as much. The itching can get very intense. I have my good days and my bad ones meaning some days i feel almost normal and then there are days when i feel completely tired. I know that this will all get better in time. I am very happy that i can go on my walks everyday.  Things you may want to have in your house after surgery is benedryl or zurtex for itching Tylenol for pain and a laxative.  I still do not know my results from the pathology report i guess i will find out at the end of the month when i finally see my Doctor. I will be updating this post for a while . What i also found helpful in the beginning was to press a pillow against my stomach in case i cough sneezed or laughed. at night i kept a pillow on my stomach to prevent me from opening the incisions do to severe itching.Has anyone used a anti itch topical after 2 weeks? I Truly appreciate any feedback to help make my days go by a little easier the itching is just torment..Sunny."
Tumor is back,Mick182,2024-10-24T02:11:55+00:00,"They found tumors on my left kidney in 2016 and performed a partial left nephrectomy. They’re back. Now they’re removing the entire kidney.
My doctor hates me. They scheduled the procedure for March. I called once to ask if I could get an earlier date. I was worried it would spread. 
I went in to talk to my doctor in person. He called me a “big fatty.” He said he’d schedule dates for Black Friday because he “hates his family anyway.” Kept complaining about the hospital and having to talk to patients rather than operate: I don’t trust him now but what options do I have. If I try to get another doctor the cancer could spread between now and whenever that new doctor schedules surgery.
I feel more alone than ever."
Stage 4 RCC that has metastasized,dez300,2024-10-28T21:23:14+00:00,"My 82yr old Mom was diagnosed with Stage 4 Kidney Cancer that has metastasized in her ribs, liver and spine. Prior to finding out she was living a normal lifestyle at her age and this has been quite a shock. By the time we were figured out what DR’s we need to see and all the tests we are now almost 4mo’s into this and so confused and scared. She started an infusion and had 2 treatments along with a pill treatment which is she is having side effects from so they took her off it.  Eating, pains and strength all are not tolerable and the meds they give her are not working so great and she says all that works with the Pain is Advil.  I am a loss on how to help her and my heart is breaking for her! I need some resources and advice to how to manage this and help her to eat, she is so nauseous and bad taste. We give her Boost and sometimes she can hold some food down but most days she can’t even eat.Her treatment plan was: Opdivo Infusions every 28days and Cabometyx pill every day!"
Cabometyx side effects,twolabs,2024-11-07T22:39:17+00:00,"hi I’m new here. My husband has been living with RCC for seven years. He had kidney removed and at the time they found spots in his lungs.  Spots were slow growing so for most of that time he has been symptom free. But over the last year cancer has spread to other areas and tumors in lungs are larger.  He was put on Cabo recently after having tried immunotherapy which caused him to develop chronic pancreatitis. Cabo has had side effects for him and I am wondering if anyone has tips on how they manage the side effects of this drug. For him it’s mainly nausea, fatigue, pain in solar plexus which could actually be the pancreatitis. Considering taking only for 5 days and giving a break of two days. Or taking at night instead of am.  Trying to help him find ways to tolerate this better. Thanks in advance."
"Almost 6years RCC free, but my Dad has level 12 PSA BPH",StephAmbler85,2024-10-16T05:06:58+00:00,"Ok... I had CC RCC and open partial nephrectomy back In Jan of 2018.

My mom passed at 54 from esophageal cancer but from alcohol and smoking cigarettes. My dad's mom had ovarian cancer and died in her 50's a few months before I was born in 1985.

Pt1b ccRCC in Nov 23 & (pre-existing) Thyroid nodule,Michael7,2024-09-22T17:02:17+00:00,"My father underwent a partial nephrectomy last November. The pathology report showed a pT1b Fuhrmangrade II tumor, measuring 4.2 cm. Right after surgery, another CT scan of the abdomen and thorax was done (also before surgery; everything clear with just a small 4 mm lung nodule), and the radiologist noted a 15 mm hypodense lesion in the thyroid but didn’t give much additional information. From what I’ve read, CT imaging doesn’t provide much insight into thyroid nodules and I'm getting more and more crazy as I go down every rabbit hole as a researcher myself.Recently, my father asked our family doctor to take another look using ultrasound, and he found 1-2 hypoechoic nodules (likely cold nodules), which supposedly haven’t changed in size. He suggested I see an endocrinologist for further tests, such as a scintigraphy.Now, after googling, of course, I came across all the worst-case scenarios, including the rare cases of RCCclear cell metastasis to the thyroid. From what I’ve seen, this happens after a significant delay, sometimes even 10 years post-surgery, and only a few hundred cases have been documented.What concerns me is that studies highlight how difficult it is to diagnose these thyroid metastases in patients with a non-thyroid cancer history—especially RCC, which apparently makes up 50% of the rare thyroid metastasis cases. Even biopsies can be misleading.Has anyone here experienced something similar or also have (cold) nodules ? I’ve seen cases online where doctors aren’t immediately worried and just keep monitoring the nodules. However, studies also emphasize that someone with a history of RCC should always be checked thoroughly for metastasis and I'm afraid of misdiagnosis. Even afraid that Pt1b is in doubt.Example for a study:

Hello,juparoni,2024-08-23T17:45:35+00:00,"In January of 2024 I was in an automobile accident.  I had a broken back, and my tumor was an incidental find while they did an MRI on my right kidney, and was 1.25 CM. 
I had to heal from my broken back before beginning this journey.In my surgical evaluation in My, the tumor had grown to 4 CM.The plan was for a partial nephrectomy via robotic surgery at the end of July.My surgery had to postponed to August 7th. So after I got out of surgery, and in my post op follow up I learned that the tumor had grown to 7CM from May until then, and they had to do a full nephrectomy.I compartmentalized the emotions, and now find myself on a rollercoaster of emotions.My dr said that my odds are favorable for this to not reoccur, but I know that it is possible.I don’t know how to emotionally process any of this.How did you move through the emotional aspects of having Cancer.I feel really scared."
Strong in Faith yet still falling apart...,MjM777,2024-09-19T04:22:37+00:00,"Falling apart but faith is strong. Having a hard time accepting the ""5 year"" survival rate diagnosis of my dear loved one, He was diagnosed with Kidney cancer and after removal of kidney tehy found at his next scan it has spread to his lungs (was found quickly) but already on both lungs. So far he just finished is 3rd round of Chemo last friday and 4th round and scans will be on his bday on Oct 4th. My faith knows that he can be healed and the healing has already begun... just wanting to hear a few positive outcomes or stories of over 5 year survivals or Maricals and prayers... because the last thing I should do is google this horrible prognosis. looking for more strength and positive stories.

Hypoechoic Kidney Lesion,rwomack00,2024-09-12T20:50:43+00:00,"Hi everyone,A little background info about myself, I’m 31 years old. I started having upper and mid right abdominal pain last October so I’ve been seeing a gastro fairly regularly to find a cause to my pain. A month ago, I went for ovary pain and my gyno requested an ultrasound. Lo and behold they found this lesion on my right kidney. It is a 2.1 x 2.4 x 2.6 hypoechoic lesion with no calcification. I was told not to worry that it could be a cyst but I was being referred to a nephrologist who was going to perform further testing. My appointment isn’t until the end of October but I’ve stressed myself out by doing my own research. Apparently, only 20-30% of these solid masses are benign. I know I don’t have concrete info due to not speaking with the doctor but I’m scared. I feel like my pain may not have been gastro after all. Has anyone else had anything similar? What questions should I bring up at my appointment?"

What do I do?I know ChRCC is rare, I know of all available studies, I understand where both recommendations come from, I understand possible risks and side effects but I am neither an oncologist nor a member of a tumourboard so how am I expected to make an informed and life-changing decision?

"""Translocation"" RCC",RandaLeigh,2014-04-04T17:11:41+00:00,"I received a phone call from my Drs office this week stating thet were performing more tests and stains on the mass they removed from my kidney.

How to overcome fear of losing your spouse?,gauchayshunk,2023-09-23T17:31:07+00:00,"Hi, kidney cancer family. My wife's story is a unique one. She found out about her kidney cancer in May of this year and by July she had a full nephrectomy of her right kidney.  After analyzing the stage 3 tumor, the surgeon said there is no evidence of spread and that they were able to completely remove the cancer. He gives her a less than 10% chance of recurrence.   So from the time we knew about the cancer to the time there is no cancer is less than two months.  But those two months were hell on earth, and I spent the whole time wondering if I was going to lose my soulmate, the mother of my 3 sons, and be left alone to keep our family moving forward.All signs now indicate that the chances of that are very small. But I can't get my brain and my heart to believe it. I am still constantly worried that my wife is going to die, and it is causing me major anxiety. I have been in to see a therapist, which has definitely been helping. But I'd like to hear from others that have gone through what I'm going through. How do you get past the anxiety of wondering if your spouse is going to die, even when it's no longer likely? My brain says that since there is a chance it will come back, that it's likely going to happen.I am desperate for any help and solace. I can't be the husband my wife needs and the father my sons need if I'm constantly anxious about my future.Thank you."
New Here - what comes next...,Matt06870,2024-08-05T15:38:08+00:00,"Hi, I have been reading and just wanted to say hello. 5 years ago the urologist found ""something"" on my kidney. The oncologist reviewed and said its quite small, no interference with kidney function lets monitor. Fast forward to March 2024 my MRI came back with 3cm Clear Cell Renal Carcinoma. Of course this stopped me on a dime. There was no evidence that it had spread (thankfully). July 1 of 2024 under went a Robotic assisted partial nephrectomy. According to the pathology reports they got it all. The challenge(s) I am facing are post surgery. Nobody knew that I had cancer. I went into the hospital on Monday of a holiday week, walked out on Wed apparently cancer free as though nothing happened… nothing changed. In reality everything has changed  - I am still recovering internally, not to mention the mood swings from March - until  July were off the chart from depression to thankful it was caught. Post July 1 my entire life changed, but to those around me, family, work etc, it's  just another day. Much like going to the dentist or something. I can't seem to  focus on anything, I'm irritable and just feel like screaming ""do you have any idea what I have and am going through?"" but what I'm going through is mental, not physical so the understanding from my community isn't there. I'm expected to be the same person - I'm not - has anyone else gone through something similar?and yes - before recommending - I do have a therapist who has been with me from the beginning. Appreciate any input/assistance Matt"

Just looking for support. Anxiety level = 1000,monnocco,2024-01-29T16:13:15+00:00,"I'm a 44 year old male. I was in Argentina (my home country) on vacation and the last day I had a horrible pain on my lower back. I went to the ER d after an all day stay and lots of meds, they told me they found kidney stones. The ER doctor seriously recommended seeing an Urologist when I return to the US because there were two ""cysts"" on my kidney (one in each 3.7cm on the right, and 2.5cm on the left). My urologist considered it an ""incidental finding"". A couple months later (Sept 2023) I had a partial Nephrectomy on my right kidney with a ""clear margin"" result. I was so happy! No chemo or anything else needed.But the follow up visit (in two weeks) is to see the left kidney's ""cyst"". The doctor thinks it has a blood supply and most likely will have to be removed.I do not have children, but I am married, and I keep thinking I am going to die. I keep having anxiety and I keep finding myself fighting fears all day long. I've been going to therapy for a couple of years for other issues and she is amazing, but I feel like that is not helping me with this. I have the need to talk to other people who have been thru the same thing or similar.I am actively looking for a cancer support group in person, but it is hard to find.

3 years NED,Tobi,2024-06-19T18:25:00+00:00,"Haven't checked in for a bit, but I wanted to update everyone. Just had my 3 yr check up and NED. I am not expecting it to come back as it was stage 1a and grade 1, but it still feels good to hear him say what we were expecting. The doc has kicked me out to yearly visits instead of 6mo and life continues. I just want to say to any new person who may read this. The beginning is scary as hell. I am not going to lie it was hands down one of the worst periods of my life. My best advice is try to keep the stress at bay, it makes it easier to focus on what you need to do and what the doctor is telling you. I had the worst time putting my emotional brain aside so I could focus on my logical brain. It's odd but it all seems so far away now. Anyways, still going strong and I should be kicked out by my doc around 5 yrs, so just going to keep plodding along!"

Just diagnosed,Thomasian,2024-06-20T12:51:12+00:00,"Hello all,TI have just been diagnosed with kidney cancer. My chest CT is on Friday. The following is the MRI results. My doctor said that it is clear cell cancer.KIDNEYS: There is a partially exophytic mass arising from the medial aspect of the upper pole of the left kidney and is well-circumscribed. It measures 4.3 x 4.2 x 4.2 cm. Relatively heterogeneous enhancement is seen within this lesion. There is notable T2 hyperintense signal within the central and caudal portions of this mass. No intrinsic T1 signal is noted.CONCLUSION: Partially exophytic mass arising from the upper pole left kidney, as described and is very suspicious for renal cell carcinoma with superimposed areas of necrosis/cystic change. No renal vein invasion. No retroperitoneal adenopathy by size criteria.Any thoughts? Has anyone had necrosis?Thanks so much,Nancy"
