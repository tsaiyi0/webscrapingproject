Basal Cell Nasal Reconstructive,Mckinney3,2024-11-01T11:29:28+00:00,"I just got the word in 2 weeks i see my Dr to make a plane for my basal cell removal across my nose and then right into reconstructive surgery!!! Iv never been so happy and scared to death at the same time. Do you guys think the flap surgery is the way to go, or get the skin graft surgery. I am so nervous for the process, I'm scared, relieved, happy and most of all unsure.. Thanks in advance for the feedback.."
Multiple skin cancer removals at once,Soup4u,2023-10-20T20:31:12+00:00,"I was recently diagnosed with 3 basal cell skin cancers.  I‚Äôm feeling really anxious about the surgery as previous Mohs surgeries have been really painful. I was hoping to get all 3 taken care of at the same time, but most places around me only do one at a time. I did find one location that would do 2 at a time . I‚Äôm just wondering which would be better? I feel like getting more done at once would be better, but will it be more painful. Has anyone ever had multiple Mohs surgeries in the same day? What was your experience like?"

dfsp -- should I be talking to onco?,ashrough,2023-11-15T05:34:59+00:00,"Hello. I'm 21 (F) and I was diagnosed with DFSP in August 2023. I had a growth just under my left breast for about 2.5 years. It was not until it drastically grew in size that I was referred to general surgery. In gen surgery, they tried to biopsy me thinking it was a cyst, only to find out it was a tumor. I then had the tumor fully taken out and was able to have negative margins without radiation/chemo. Now here's what I'm worried about. It was only through my surgeon that I was able to hear that (1) I had cancer, and (2) had negative margins and have ""nothing to worry about"". I haven't talked directly to someone specializing in oncology or have more specific knowledge about DFSP in my journey. If I didn't need chemo or radiation, would it be excessive/unnecessary that I try talking to someone more specialized? In addition, should I be arranging regular annual meetings? navigating the health system alone has been overall really difficult and I would really like some advice! Thank you so much"
"In 1 week, I‚Äôm having scalp surgery",CathySueH02,2024-10-08T05:18:38+00:00,"There is a tumor, a rare type of skin cancer close to the crown of my head.  I believe they‚Äôre removing about 3‚Äù of my scalp.

MOHS Surgery Shock,Litl18,2024-07-04T16:44:38+00:00,"I am hoping to hear from anyone having had MOHS surgery and is willing to share your recovery and healing process, including products and/or procedures used. 
I had MOHS surgery two days ago to remove a cancerous spot in the area between my upper lip and my nose. The spot is about the size of a pencil eraser‚Ä¶but I ended up with 21 stitches that goes into my upper lip. I am swollen, woke up with blood on my mouth and chin, plus a blood clot formed on my lip stitches. I cleaned the whole area with a gauze pad and water followed by a layer of Aquaphor and covered it with gauze. I have also been puttting ice on it throughout the day. I am in shock that I have 21 stitches that run into my lip, which makes it difficult to drink and eat. I‚Äôve been taking pain meds to help manage the pain and discomfort. While I am thankful that the cancer has been removed, I am hoping to hear what I can expect as far as the healing process and scaring. It‚Äôs not a pretty sight right now but I know it needs time to heal. I just want to be realistic about what I can expect to get out of the healing process. I‚Äôve been told to purchase scar pads (as opposed to scar gel) and was wondering if there is a specific brand that works best? Thank you for reading this and looking forward to your experience and suggestions."
Absolutely TERRIFIED,guitarsouth,2024-08-23T22:32:18+00:00,"HHi folks, I must say, it really hurts to have to join this forum.MMy situation looks bad because what I THOUGHT was an ingrown whisker is obviously cancer.  My nurse yesterday knew as soon as she saw it.  She said unfortunately, the waiting line to see the dermatology doctor is around 2 months.PProblem is, I assumed this whisker  was just not healing and I have waited darn near a year and a half, maybe even 2 years before I got it checked.MMy son freaked out when I sent him a photo of it.  It looks like melonoma to me, he sent a PIC to cha GDP and it says it looks like one of the other 2.II am 62 years old and live alone, lasnight was my first night with this horrible knowledge.  I just took a PIC of it on this phone I will use for this forum, but I know it looks real bad.  I am of course, hoping for support, and foods or meds over the country I should get.  The nurse told me to get Aquaphor or some such, I did find it, she said put a thin layer on it, and she reffered me to Hyland detrmatology here in Cookeville, TN, I am waiting for them to call and setup an appointment for me, no doubt it will be a long wait and this has already Bern active for a long time.  I feel really scared.  I am posting the PIC I just now took, thanks so much for any support or advice."
MOHS on ear?,airborne72,2024-03-20T12:55:48+00:00,"I have a persistent SCC on my ear that was treated by the low dose radiation method last summer, but it has returned.  My next option is to cut it out (MOHS).  This is my concern.  I don't have much ""meat"" on my ears and this lesion is on one of those areas.  It seems to me that the distance between the skin and the cartilage is very thin.  Therefore, if a MOHS procedure is conducted then we will risk cutting a hole in my ear.Anyone with a similar experience?  On the positive side, if I do end up with a hole in my ear then I might just get a piercing to fill it in.  My daughters and granddaughters would be proud.Jim"
Spot that won‚Äôt heal,Shannytay,2024-09-24T15:38:51+00:00,"After showing a friend these spots on my knee and one below knee, she ask me to get it checked. I have appointment in a few weeks.

Another spot started below but not like the raised one. Thanks for your time."
New to this group.,Kickapo28,2023-05-12T22:07:16+00:00,"Hi. I first got melanoma in 2016. Surgically removed from my lower leg and 3 more surgeries for new spots that popped up. Been on immunotherapy for 12 months. Combo now of OPDIVO and Yervoy. Side effects are not too bad. Had big problems with pills prescribed before. My last surgery was in October 2021. I ask myself if I still have melanoma. All surgeries in my left,lower leg. Never spread anywhere else. Pet scans been good, however oncologist continues to remind me this disease can be microscopic and not show up in the scans.  Regular visits to the dermatologist reveal no new trouble spots. Their fear, and mine, is I have lots of moles in that area. Have worries about this but luckily not all consuming ( most of the time). Just seems like unless you are dealing with this, not much understanding from others."
Yervoy as a preventative?

Each time they go in to find where the bleeding is coming from it is a new place.¬† One time the Dr. wrapped blood clotting mesh around her organs. he said her insides are raw.¬† Last night her heart rate went sky high and her blood pressure dropped again, they did surgery again.¬† Now the artery to her spleen has ruptured.¬† They say this Yervoy can continue to do damage for 6 more weeks.¬† I'm so angry!!!¬† I want to yell and scream at some one.¬† Preferrably her Oncologist who has not shown her face in the hospital, but has left this mess up to other doctors to try to stop or repair the damage."

Skin cancer support,4MJM,2024-04-09T01:17:04+00:00,"Today I had my 13th surgery to remove a basal cell and have had melanomas in the past cancer road of 20 years (I am 39). I am so blessed with my history of finding them early and an amazing dermatologist. I have finally put my finger to why I have been mentally struggling, and I believe it is the lack of support of people going through something similar to relate to. I have amazing friends and family that support me and am ashamed to admit I hide and downplay what I go through often because I don‚Äôt want to be a victim and know how good I have it. That being said, I don‚Äôt have anyone to talk some of this through with who can offer more than ‚Äúsorry to hear that‚Äù with each diagnosis.

Multiple primary melanomas,lovetheskinyourin,2024-06-08T11:31:36+00:00,"Hello!I write to hear others stories, because I don't know anyone who's had melanoma. In the last 2.5 years, I have had 3 melanomas (2 insitu and one 1a). I've also had one basal cell. In an effort not to devastate myself, I didn't goggle anything. But thought to seek the experience of others. Anyone else traveling a similar path? I have 3 month check ups and also AI scanning every 9 months. I have had genetic testing, which came back negative. I have over 600 moles/spots. Most are all atypical. Besides the sunscreen, UV clothing, check ups and overall intentional mindfulness of the sun- anything else I should be seeking out/doing? Any other treatment you'd recommend?Appreciate the insight and your time. Thank you!!"
Basal Cell Carcinoma and Niacinamide (vitamin B3),adriandegrassie,2024-07-01T22:14:11+00:00,"I am looking for others who have experience with taking Niacinamide for skin cancers.  I have had skin cancer surgeries of all manner since 1987, with increasing frequency as the years moved on.  Almost all were basal cell (couple squamous, and two melanoma insitu).  In 2020 a radiation oncology doctor told me to use Niacinamide, that it would boost my immune system to fight skin cancers, but not cure them.  I had never before seen tangible physical results with a supplement until Niacinamide.  It appears to be ‚Äúpushing‚Äù the cancers out of my skin, slowly.  I have had a number that just become larger small mounds on my skin and eventually fall off.  However, I think it is also pushing damaged cells to the outer skin more rapidly than would otherwise have happened.  These remain on the surface (superficial) as flat spots.  If biopsied, they show up as basal cells, and the Dermatologists of course want to cut it out.  These have been the focus of my last 5 to 10 surgeries.  I wonder if they would just go away eventually.  The Dermatologists don‚Äôt believe that the Niacinamide is doing this.  But this pushing new pre-cancers (?) to the surface has only happened to me since starting this treatment."

I was recently diagnosed with metastatic cutaneous (skin) squamous cell cancer. History: I had had Mohs surgery to remove a lesion on my left arm in 2019.  Just this past November, I had an MRI for a sore arm/shoulder (unrelated) and they noticed an enlarged lymph node under my left arm.  Fine needle biopsy showed squamous cell cancer.My brain scan and PET scan were negative except for ""moderate uptake"" in a left neck node.  Thankfully, the neck node was negative on biopsy.I begin immunotherapy this week (Cemiplimab/Libtayo) for 2 to 3 sessions, then they will remove a few or all of my axillary nodes (depending on whether immunotherapy works).  If it doesn't work, I will need radiation too.Anyone out there with metastatic squamous skin cancer?  Thank you."

Recurrent Squamous Cell Skin Cancer,IfYouHaveaPulse,2017-04-15T18:57:07+00:00,"Hi all,
Happy to have found this forum. I had my first squamous cell lesion removed (with margins) in May 2015. I discovered it after some of the ink didn't take in a tattoo I got over a sore that had been there for over 2 years. Funny enough, the ink didn't take in part of the letter P of Pain. My tattoo was: HOPE - Hang On Pain Ends. Anyhow, was above my wrist on my left arm and it was removed successfully. Fastworward to a few weeks ago. I noticed I had two new sores/lesions on same arm, first between my elbow and shoulder and second on shoulder. They appeared quickly, were hard, painful and were itchy. Dr did punch biopsies on both and both came back Squamous Cell. Had wide excision with margins and down to subcutaneous fat layer on the shoulder one Thursday morning. I begged him to do both at the same time but he wouldn't. In the mean time, while I wait for pathology report on this one I am doing research on why I have had two recurrences at the same time on same arm as the first and both squamous cell. Best I can tell from what I've researched they are both stage 2.
I am feeling emotionally conflicted about my worry and concerns because I am the first to say to myself, my doctor and others, I did this to myself. Choices have consequences. I ignored every single person who told me to stay out of the sun and tanning beds since I started around age 13, I am now 45. As ridiculous as this may sound, at that young age I stupidly delighted in each sun burn, thinking I would be more attractive once I was tan. The only way I can describe it is feeling like, I made my bed and now it's time to lie in it, I have no right or business to get to 'feel' anything about it.
What I am mostly feeling right now is: curious and hungry for information on other's experience, treatment, recurrence, recommendations! Thanks in advance and prayers and healing thoughts to everyone here!"
Should I listen to the doctor or my fear,alamo3,2023-07-03T23:04:59+00:00,I saw all the oncologists today.. He said to relax Surgeries in 3 weeks.. But it is nodular melanoma.. At least 1 mm..
