Would you?,joanagan,2024-11-06T01:27:57+00:00,"I am 81 years old.  I tested positive for slight blood in my stools.  I hate having a colonoscopy because of the prep.  I know that the efficiency of screening declines at the age of 75 and is not even recommended at the age of 85.  I will not get radiation, nor chemo therapy.  Is there even a need to pursue it?"
Tubulovillous adenoma question,Summer91,2024-11-03T14:54:22+00:00,"All, in 2019, my gastroenterologist removed a 2cm flat polyp from rectum that was classified as a Tubulovillous adenoma.  I know this is a benign polyp but does have a 20% -40% chance of becoming malignant (different % depending on sources).  Due to the pandemic and life issues, I did not have another colonoscopy until last week.   Another polyp was discovered directly adjacent to the site of the removed polyp but was more tubular than flat.  The gastroenterologist said he did not feel comfortable removing it because of the scar tissue.  He did a biopsy and the pathology report again classifies the polyp as Tubulovillous adenoma.  He says it needs to be surgically removed.  Has anyone had this surgery?  Any problems or adverse effects?  Thanks!"
Stage 3 Rectal cancer Recurrence,hasanghp,2024-10-17T07:39:51+00:00,"HiI am male with 37 years oldI was diagnosed with stage 3 rectum cancer Aug 2023 about 6 cm tumor in my rectum and 8 cm distance to anal verge .I did first CT for checking metastas and it was clear.My oncologist decided  6 rounds of chemotherapy with folfox. After it was ended, I did my second CT and shows that tumor size has been reduced about 50%, at least 4 lymph are in abnormal size, also a sub centimeter lesion in Lt. lobe 4 of my liver that should be follow up.after that I started 28 radiotherapy plus oral xeloda. At Feb 2024 I did LAR surgery. Pathology answer shows 4/5 lymph invasions and margins are free and IHC results showed wild kras and no mutation . Apr 2024 reversed colestomy. After that I did 6 Adjuvant chemo with Folfox + Cetuximab+Bevacizumab. All process was completed at Jun 2024. 
1 week ago I did first follow up PET/CT after 3 months from last chemo ending and unfortunately it shows 1 tumor in lobe 6 of my liver about 1cm dimension. after I have seen this result I’m so feared and scared. My oncologist suggested interventional radiology to destroy tumor. I didn’t expect recurrence to occur in this short time"

Recovery from Lower Anterior Resection?,prairyfire,2024-04-20T02:55:52+00:00,I’m scheduled for a lower anterior resection for my stage 3 rectal cancer.  I’ve had 6 rounds of FolFurinox and six weeks of 5fu and radiation.  I’m 46 and still working full time.  I would like to hear from anyone who has had the LAR and what the surgery recovery is like?  When were you able to return to work?  Any helpful advice for quick recovery?  I’m trying my best to balance cancer and career and family…. Any advice would be helpful. Thanks in advance.
Pet scans,aussTex,2024-10-22T17:03:35+00:00,"I’ve had two primary cancers, breast and now s4 lung cancer requiring quarterly ct or pet scans. After about a year of an area in my colon showing persistent focal uptake, my oncologist insisted I have a colonoscopy. Thankfully it was only an advanced precancer, 1.1 cm tubulovillious, fully resected, clear margins, but the colon oncologist said if i had waited six more months I would have had a primary colon cancer. My only symptoms that disappeared a week after were intense bloating and mucous in diarrhea. 11 weeks later I had my routine pet scan which again showed uptake, higher than last time (was 12.1 now 16.4). Colon oncologist said it’s probably an inflammatory response to the removal, and that he didn’t miss anything, and even gave me pictures of the poly, etc. But my colonoscopy went much longer than expected, and he told my family is was difficult because I have a redundant colon, so it took longer and more staff to help move and reposition me so they could get all the imaging. In fact, somehow they blew the vein my iv was in, and I woke up during, then they accessed a vein in my foot for the remainder of the procedure. He said not to worry about it, that if my next pet scan still shows activity there he can do another colonoscopy. My next scan is mid January. I’ve heard colon cancer is slow growing, so if somehow something was left behind it wouldn’t be growing like crazy. I’m not concerned they didn’t get it all, but that they missed another one because of the rolling, repositioning and waking going on. Has anyone here had pet or ct scans after a polypectomy??? Does anyone else have an extra long colon? What SUV is considered concerning in the colon? Why would a precancer have such a high SUV??? My lung cancer was stage 4 but only had an SUV of 4.7! Any insight at all would be helpful!"
Metastasis to Peritoneum,michaelmcc,2024-10-18T14:50:51+00:00,Has anyone had colon cancer that has metastasized to the peritoneum that can share some positive recovery experience with me?

First Post Stage IV,Onmyfeet,2023-09-20T21:18:39+00:00,"After reading stories for two years and and talking with people who are in the fight, I was encouraged to share my story. I can only hope it helps someone.After 3 months of testing; blood, stool, urine. Dr.'s were convinced I had IBS and stress induced constipation.  A colonoscopy was finally ordered. I was diagnosed December 7, 2021.  A mass was found at the base of my colon.  They said not to worry I would have surgery the following week to have it removed. A CT was ordered to determine exact size and location of the mass.  The CT revealed I had 12 spots spread through both sides of my liver.  I was now diagnosed stage IV, and was told surgery was not an option.  I was 36 years old.My Port was put in in January of 2022. I immediately started chemotherapy.  My initial regime was leucovorin, oxaliplatin, irinotecan,  fluorouracil, and mvasi, every two weeks.  I did 6 cycles of this and had another Ct.  This scan showed the chemo was working.  All of the cancer had shrunk, and 4 spots had disappeared. My case went before a tumor board and they decided surgery was an option.  I did 5 more rounds of chemo and had my first liver resection in July of 2022.  It was a nine hour surgery.  Surgery was considered a success, with clear margins. Post surgery my stomach shut down for 3 days and I developed a soft tissue channel/sinus in my chest that would not close due to the constant fluid flow from around my liver. This wound would not close for almost a year. I did 2 more rounds of chemo in September of 2022 and prepared for my colon surgery in October.I woke up form colon surgery with a surprise ostomy bag.  This was quite the surprise but I was informed it was only temporary and again surgery was considered successful with clear margins.    At the end of December 2022 I had my ostomy reversal.  I was ready to start a new year.In January of this year I had a follow up CT.  It revealed 4 spots had shown back up on my liver. My Dr.'s decided on more chemo and a second liver resection. This chemo regime was dialed back to only irinotecan, the  fluorouracil, and mvasi, I did 5 rounds, again every two weeks.I had my second liver resection in May.  This surgery was only 7 hours, mainly due to the amount of scar tissue and the fact that while trying to free my liver from the scar tissue and my diaphragm, my lung was nicked, requiring a chest tube for a few days. They closed the chest wound that had been open since the previous July, and again, clear margins.My oncologist gave me the option; take 3 months off and then we'll do another scan, or do a few rounds of ""mop up"" chemo and then a scan.  As much as I craved a break, I decided to opt for the chemo.  I did 3 rounds and got another CT.  This one revealed 3 more spots on the liver.  At this time my oncologist determined the irinotecan to be ineffective.  We would continue the chemo but switch back to the oxaliplatin, leucovorin,  fluorouracil, and mvasi. I have done 4 rounds of this, with 2 more scheduled before my next scan.As I right this I am currently on a 3 week break before my next 2 rounds and another CT.  I am celebrating my 38th birthday. I am enjoying the time with my wife and two boys(4 and 2). I am golfing, camping and enjoying wine. Through this whole process, I have only stopped work to recover from surgery and taken the occasional Friday off to recover from chemo.  I have met and talked with other people fighting who have it much worse then me. I refuse to let this disease make me feel sorry for myself, I refuse to let it dictate my life any more then necessary.  This disease is not who we are, it is not the defining point of our life, if it gets me in the end, I am determined to go out on my feet. We can never stop fighting!"
Won't schedule surgery because I'm paying cash,rogue_life,2024-07-31T22:45:51+00:00,"Hi All, I was diagnosed with colon cancer in April, It took until June to have the colonoscopy done. The  tumor is located in the ascending colon and Dr requested a surgical consult on June 28.  Tomorrow is August st and the appointment is still not scheduled. When I asked why they said it was because I was paying cash instead of using insurance. Why does form of payment disqualify me for treatment?"

How worried should I be from latest MRI results?,pbiflyer,2024-10-04T14:26:09+00:00,"4 years ago, was diagnosed with colorectal cancer in a polyp. The lab results showed it was invasive to the edge of the polyp. Had just a rectal excision for the area around the polyp and it showed no cancer. Forward 3 years and I was diagnosed with prostate cancer. Prostate was removed in April and again, the cancer was up to the edge of the removed portion. The doctor seemed to think that was fine. PSA and CEA tests come back negative at the end of July.MRI earlier this week showed thickening of the wall.They called it T1/T2.  But they caveated it, saying it could be due to underdistention. So how worried should I be? Any insight? Colonoscopy is scheduled in 2 very long weeks away. Results:IMPRESSION:1. T1/2 N0.  Suggestion of annular rectal wall thickening in the mid rectum although this is nonspecific and may be due to underdistention, the muscularis propria is intact as well as the mesorectal fascia widely clear, recommend correlation with colonoscopy for intraluminal evaluation.

"Father starting chemo soon, any advice?",sunflowerdaughter,2024-07-19T00:15:04+00:00,My father is 67 and recently diagnosed with colon cancer after finding a partial obstruction due to a tumor. He already had the resection but 4 lymph nodes showed some cancer so now he will be getting a port next week and starting folfox soon every other week for 6 months. Any advice on what to do to keep side effects to a minimum? Any foods to avoid or to eat? I am worried about keeping his spirits up because he already seems defeated. Any advice is welcome!

I am 3 years 2 months NED (thank God) but still have excessive bowel movements, much gas and terrible spasms.  I have tried many medications and nothing seems to work very well.  Some days, I am perfectly fine but others; ugh...It is getting hard to travel and I was wondering if anyone has IBS what do you do for it and what do you take (if anything).  I have tried to pinpoint foods that might trigger these attacks but to no avail.  Thanks for listening."
Help me understand,Nikki1983,2024-09-15T14:46:30+00:00,"My colorectal cancer went from early (stage 0) to stage IIIc. So all my trust and faith in Mercy medical care has been used up. But their overly optimistic feeling oncologist tried to sell me 80% odds of complete recovery and my own research says 44% odds of complete recovery. I also feel like Mercy would say literally anything to stop me from suing my onetime PCP for dismissing my complaints for two years, that's right, a steady two years of bloody stools before he referred me to someone who listened and ran testing.And I get everyone's optimistic attitudes but my PCP failed me.  So I'm going to live, but I'm so mad I just want to punch someone, which isn't my personality at all. I'm becoming a stranger and monster.  But I'm losing all of worldly goods, probably even our ****box apartment and once again no one is helping. I can't keep running my fiancé ragged with work to tread water and expecting her to be my caregiver! I'm so sorry for the dumping, I really needed an outlet and some help/a guide/hope."

Stage 4 Colon Cancer update,sammer4u,2013-08-20T18:58:07+00:00,"It has been quite some time since I have visited this site, mainly becuae I have been very busy.  I found out I had stage IV colon cancer November 6, 2011 at the age of 41 after finding a tumor in my colon.  They removed the tumor, gave me a colostomy and tested the tumor.  December 2011 I had a power port installed in my left shoulder area, and started chemo end of the year.  After two treatments they had to remove the power port as it was leaking emfactic fluid.  Apparently the tube was too close to the duct that carries the fluid and drained into the port tube.  When the port was accessed they would get a white milky fluid out of it and would continue to flow while accessed.  They then installed a PICC line in my left bicep.  This I was told was to be in of replacing in about 4-6 weeks.  I coudl feel everythign as they did the PICC line insertion, as the doctor admitted they may not have numbed the area enough.  But he proceeded, and after that experience I said that it had better last longer than 6 weeks as I had 10 more treatments to go.  I had a PET scan which was an experience I will never forget.  They bring the special cocktail in a cement lined box (makes you wonder a bit) and tell you after you get injected with it to jus tlie there, do not move, do not hink about anything.  And after the scan is performed, they tell you to make sure you drink plenty of fluids and stay away from pregnanet women and young chidren.  I went thru at least 7 treatments and the ocnologist determined the tumors were shrinking.  I had 6 tumors in my liver, and one actually disappeared.  After meeting with a liver specialist it was determned that I was a canidate for a liver resection.  I need the approval to move forward because of my stage and location of tumors.  My oncologist said that after the met the specialist that I woudl be a shoe in for the surgery, being that I was ""young"".  In the next few weeks I had numerous tests, visits to the hospital to get me prepped for the surgeries that would entail.  May 2012 I had a procedure called a Portal Vein Embolization.  The doctor went in removed a tumor on the left side of my liver, and tied off the blood flow to the right side.  This was to force the left side to grow and promte the healthy part of the liver to stay healthy.  The Portal Vein Embolization was done laproscopically, and was a quick heal time.  After 4 weeks of post surgery time, they determined the left side was doing well and growing and the next step was to be liver resection.  I went in the end of June and all went well.  I came out with a huge backwards ""L"" on my lower stomach area and of course sore.  I went in June 28 got out July 2.  The summer here was very hot and dry which did not help me out any.  Once home I was very uncomfortable.  They gave me some pain medicine and said I was to take a stool softner with it.  Well, we forgot to get the stool softner and found out the hardway why I was told to get it.  Rushed to the hospital for internal cramping and pain, after they gave me some Magnesium Citrate (my new firend) I was fine.  The entire time I was home I slept in a recliner.  July 7th I was waken up with pain in the incision area.  It was a Sunday and no one was available for consult but said to take some aspirn and continue to monitor the area.  Mondya July 8th I called the hospital again in pain, and redness and swelling in the incison area.  After sending a picture via cell phone to the doctor they were going to determine what they wanted me to do.  An hour later they called and said they wanted me to be at the hospital at 11:30.  It was already 10:15 and it takes an hour to get to the hosptial and I needed to find a ride in as my wife was finally at work.  I got to the hospital at 11:35, checked in and waited in the doctors office.  For whatever reason I decided to stand while waiting.  They got me in quickly and as I sat down in the doctors chair I felt a wet liquid running down my belly.  I pulled up my shirt and there was this puss oozing from the horizontal incision.  I had an infection.  I was admitted over night and pumped with antibiotics.  I was informed I coudl take a shower on Saturday after my Monday departure from the hosptial and have a feeling that is what caused the infection.  I live on a well system, and that may have caused me more inssues than just getting clean!  Anyhow, I now had an open wound that needed to be wet/dry packed 3 times a day.  Not sure how long, but had numerous visits to check out afterwards.  My final chemo treatments were put on hold.  At this point I was 9 months into my fun, and this was the very first time I decided I was done playing this game. I wanted to be done, be able to do what I wanted.  I was finally healed up enough that my chemo treatments could continue, and it was finally September.  After my 8 treatments I was able to scheudle my ostomy reversal.  That surgery took place November 16, 2012 one year and 10 days from the start of this.  After getting thru this surgery and passing some solid stool normally I was released home.  Then the long road to recovery and a normal life ofr so i thoiught.  I had a follow up with my Oncologist in mid December and things were looking good. He said to me that he had to modify a stage III scheudle but here is what we were going to do.  Follow up visits every 2 months for the first two years.  Then 4 months for the next year, and then 6 months to the first 5 years.  Then the next 5 yeasrs (a total of 10) I woudl see him once a year.  Well, none of this sank in until I went to see my surgeon as a follow up to the ostomy reversal and said that I had to have a modified stage III scheudle.  She said, yeah that does not surprise me becuase you were not suppose to be here with us.  That is when it really hit me!  Stage IV was a serious stage.  I never unitl this point in January 2013, realized what kind of battle I was going thru.  I never gave it any thought.  I just wanted to move forward and did everything the doctors asked of me.  I never once looked back.  The only time I felt down and wore out was with the open wound.  That drained me.  At that point it made me think about things a bit and realized that for 41 years of my life I made it without one surgery.  Now in the course of 375 days i had 9 surgeries.  All of which I was told was serious.  My liver specialist (now I realize what she was talking about) mentioned that she has done a ""few"" of the Portal Vein Embolizations and liver resectiosn on someone of my state. She never operated on anyone with more than 3 tumors.  She said that her professional opinion was that if I can stay clear for 2 years that I will be good to go!   I continue that thought today.  I was given a clear adgenda, to do whatever I want, to eat whatever I want, to live life to it's fullest.  We questioned the specialist after the follow up after the liver resection about my diet and beer...  she said ""hell this is Wisconsin, go have a brat and a beer"".  Of course I do not over indulge, but I enjoy a brat and beer every so often.  Getting back to the PICC line, I only had one, and it was in me for 48 weeks.  Never had to have it replaced or checked out.  It did give me a issue a couple of times, but never bad enough to have to replace. Also for my chemo treatments, I was in the oncologists office for 5-6 hours getting the cocktail, and left with a pump for the next 46 hours.  
 
My whole point to this is to give a little insight to all going thru this whether it is as serious or less serious as myself.  I hope to let anyone know that even though it is a stage IV condition or lower, never give up hope.  I never knew (probably best for me) what stage IV meant, nor did I care.  I just wanted to move on with my life.  I met a great woman in August of 2011, and she stuck with me thru the whole ordeal.  She helped with everythign flushing of my PICC lines, to packing my wound.  I did marry her this past August as a matter of fact.  I have never felt as good as I do now.  And I honestly can say I did not have a negative experience with anything I went thru.  the Infection/open wound wa a bit hairy, but I made it thru and with my beatiful girlfriend at the helping and pushing made the difference.  I am not saying I am a poster child for this, nor am I a hero... but I am here to help and talk about everything and anything about this whole ordeal.  I had a friend of mine get diagnoised with the same thing 1 week before I was.  He was going thru the same treatment scheudle, however he did not make it. He died from his issues 6 months after we found out.    I don't claim to have all the answers, or the correct ones however I do have answers for what I dealt with and went thru. 
 
I know this is a long read, and if you are still here after all that reading it means that you have questions, or I was able to answer them, or you went thru something similar.  I honestly encourage anyone of you starting to go thru this, have been thru this, are in the middle of this, or are a caretaker to ask me anything.  Again I am willing to answer anything and that literally means anything.  You want to know about the most embarassing or private moments or what to expect..  let me have it and let it be known that you will get an answer.  Please feel free to private message me, and I will get you my email address.  I do not check this site to often, and decided to check it out this afternoon after lunch.  I feel I might be able to give some hope, insight, and let you see the light at the end of a tunnel that many doctors try to paint. Hate to say it, but I HAVE been there and HAVE done that for the most part!
 
I am currently clear and now the oncologist has bumped me up to every 4 months for check ups.  Feels good about my progress and outcome so far!
 
Hope everyone is well, and moves on.  Pleae remember that most of this is aobut your mindset.  Never let it get you down. Live everyday as if you had no problems at all.  Never let it sideline you, or use Cancer as an excuse! I appolgise for any spelling errors as I was trying to get alot of information out while trying to get back to work.  I have left out a lot of stuff which I can and will share if interested!"
Buster's Story,BusterBrown,2011-01-11T02:53:22+00:00,"On Dec 14th, at age 42, I was diagnosed with Stage IV Colon cancer, it had spread to my liver. Several weeks later, after doing some research and talking with a few doctors, I elected to do chemo (folfox)in hopes that my cancer would shrink. After 3 doses of Folfox the three spots I had on my liver were gone and my primary tumor had shrunk. A month later, I had a colon resection and I was fortunate my doctor only took 8"".   Several weeks later I was back on Folfox and a month after that I started radiation. They radiated the site of the resection, and I'm happy to report it's not come back. After my 5th week of radiation and tenth dose of chemo, I was scanned and it was determined that I was in remission. Fast forward Feb 2005, had a Ct Scan, cancer was back in my liver, this time, one spot. I elected to have open surgery and my doctor Cryo'd my tumor and felt confident he got it all. Was back to work in 3 weeks. In June,2005 we did another CT Scan, cancer gone! Fast forward to Febuary Oct 2008, had ct scan, spot appears on my liver, seems to be in the same place as cryo'd spot. This time around I elect for another open surgery, this time surgeon does liver resection. I also start folfiri regimine. At this point, I'm seemingly in remission, but I have to wait 3-6 months to see if anything popped up.  Fast forward to Nov. 2009, feel pain in my right lung, they do a ct scan, this time they find a tumor in the plural(lining) of my lung, it's inoperable and the only way to treat it is chemo. From Nov. to this day, I'm still getting chemo treatments, I go once a month, I've had 42 doses up to this point. I hope to do 40 more:)Today, I'm happy to report that I seem to be keeping this cancer in check.  My overall health is good, I go to work everyday, I chase my 8 year old boy around, and most people I know don't even know I'm sick. Best advice I can give is don't stop living, don't let this disease rule your life. Compartmentalize your illness and visit it when you must, but when you're done, put your illness back on the shelf and live your life. Head down and full speed ahead:)"
Stage 4c colon cancer,atxmom,2024-09-17T15:35:52+00:00,"I’m new to this forum and looking for information regarding my daughter, now 41, who is 22 months into treatment for colon cancer that had metasticized to her ovaries, 8 of 38 lymph nodes, omentum and peritoneum.  She had a successful cytoreductive surgery initially with colostomy,  followed by 12 chemo treatments of Folfirinox, then a second surgery to remove anything suspicious, reverse the colostomy and perform HIPEC, but within 6 months, a PET scan revealed four spots on the peritoneum so she just completed 12 more treatments minus the oxyplatin due to severe neuropathy. I may be premature with this question since her PET scan isn’t done yet and the Signaterra results aren’t in, but the surgeon, who is so very gifted, believes another surgery to remove anything suspicious along with the HIPEC procedure should be the next step regardless of the results of these tests. I appreciate that the surgeon wants to be aggressive because of my daughter’s age and her young boys, but I’m discouraged that the first HIPEC didn’t keep the cancer at bay but for 6 months. Would maintenance chemo do the same or perhaps intermittent Folfirinox? How many times can a body endure that type of trauma?  If we wait until the cancer is visible again before doing another HIPEC, might it turn up in an even worse location?  Are there any stories of people surviving secondary peritoneal cancer for very long??I’m sorry to throw out so many questions but if anyone has experience with a similar situation, please share."

That Christmas, we were engaged and married at a little country church at Glade Valley, NC where I graduated from HS on Sept 8, 2012 in front of family and friends. My son and 2 grandchildren were there as well as her 2 daughters and son and we became a blended family. In 2011, Gail discovered a lump on her right arm and went to a cancer doctor and he found it was cancerous. He operated and removed that lump and 9 lymphnodes. The only chemo she needed was sunscreen he jokeddMoving on to March, 2017 when we noticed that her hands were shaking. We were living in Richmond, Va. there where I was working and she had retired. She went to the doctor and she was admitted for tests. 4  tumors were found in her brain and another under her right arm. Terrible news. Stage 4 brain cancer with no cure. Her doctor informed us that there was no cure and she could give us 1 month, 6 months, or a year. We were shocked and crying as she stepped out of the room while we talked and prayed. Cancer had already hit our family when our oldest daughter, Mindy, was found to have stage 3 cervical cancer in Sept the previous year and now this. We called Mindy and decided to have the tumors removed. Tests showed the cancer had not spread except to the brain and that the lymph node was the culprit. The surgeon removed the tumors from her brain and left the one under her arm.  Gail handled like a trooper, smiling, laughing working with her tablet like the surgery was nothing.She didn't need chemo but had immunotherapy. At first it did well. I hired a aide to come take care of her while I worked after her son left and the two of them got along great. We had family and friends visit and call. We went to church one time and the minister said a prayer over her but we knew that it wouldn't last.July, Gail's appetite was going away. She could hardly walk They had upped the imuno therapy and that made her worst. The decision was made to take away the medicine and put her in  rehab center to get her strength back so she could walk. I was there everyday after I had worked 8 hours, jumping as the phone rang hoping it wasn't about her. Towards the end of July, she got worst, wasn't eating and her blood pressure was real high. She was taken to the ER and was found to be deyhydrated and admiited. We decided to move her to another place which was the right move and they took over her care.That became the beginning to the end.  Gail was not eating much and drinking more but the sign of coming to the end of her life was there. Days moved on where she became where she saw things that weren't there, wanting to go shopping, and wanted to go home. We had a little dog that loved her mommy and everytime I went she went to visit..On the 3rd of August, we renewed our vows. Our minister came to hospice and did it short and sweet. I loved that woman very much and prayed more than I ever did to please stop her suffering. A big test of my faith was going on.The last week leading up to the 17th of August was just sitting there in a chair, watching her sleep. I knew something was going to happen. Mindy came up to be with her mother and then John and Karla (son and wife) came up on Thursday as well as my best friend Paul The 17th was a long day. We went across the street to eat supper and came back Mindy went back to her hotel room and i sat in the chair beside her bed. Someone then said she's not breathing. I got up and went outside into the hallway while people came in and checked. John came out and  told me she was gone. My life was turned upside downThe rest of that evening, I made phone calls to Hospice and the minister whose wife came to help. Family members were notified, we finally found a place to take her to be cremaated and then waited. Gail died at 6:30 Thursday night and was taken away at 1:30 am the next morning.John drove Paul and I back to our apartment and I petted the dogs who were going home with Mindy the next day. I was tired but had a lot to do. I got on Facebook and made the announcemnt that Gail was dead and free of cancer and pain. I then went to bed.The next morning, Mindy picked up the dogs and went back to Winston. Plans were a memorial service on that Sunday at our church in Richmond and then Labor Day Sunday in WInston-Salem for friends and family who couldn't make it to the first one. I went with John and Karla to sign the papers to get her cremated and paid them. Then back to where I picked up my car and I ran some errands. I prayed to God to give me the strength to get this horrible thing happening in my life. I went to where I worked and told them where I could take as much time off work as I wanted. Home and worked on the obituary sending one to the Richmond Times and Winston-Salem Journal to be published on Sunday. The rest of the time I don't remember. Paul was there to help me as much as he could. We prayed and prayed.Sunday came and the memorial service was perfect. Singing, people talking about Gail, and then I got up in front of the congregation and talked. This was planned by the two of us before she died and I got thru it with no notes and straight from my heart. I felt Gail right beside me and cheering me on. Short and sweet.  We left after hugs and went back to my place. John, Karla, and Paul had to leave and I was left alone. I stood outside, all alone, thinking NOW WHAT. I thought I was prepared but I wasn't. I prayed to God to help me thru this. Still hadn't given up.The next couple of weeks were a blur. Getting the death cerficates copies for the life insurance compnay, bank and apartment complex. People sent flowers and gave support. I picked up her ashes the Monday before Labor Day and then took the train to Winston. She always wanted to ride the train and unfortunately it was the last trip she made.Friday, I went to the court house to check on her will that nobody could find. I knew that I had drawn up wills for both of us. Couldn't but there was no estate and everyone knew what was going to happen with the life insurance money. Her kids would a 1/3 rd each and I got the rest to put back in my savings account.Labor Day Sunday came and another memorial service. A large crowd filled the church and the minister that married us did the service. Again, I got up and spoke and Paul had to finish a poem that I had found. Monday, I went back to Richmond to try to get my life back together. Still praying to God for help and guidance.People say that man has gone through enough. I thought so but God had a plan for me that I didn't expect. A year later, I was dianosed with PTSD and tremors  from losing Gail and lost my job. I moved back to Winston to live with my mother until I could find another place to live and a job. That didn't happen.Fast forward to 2021; I was going to have my left knee replaced. I went to get my blood drawn and my doctor called stating I need a blood transfusion and that my PSA was high No knee replacement and in November,,  I was found to have stage 3 prostrate cancer. No surgery but radiation therapy which went on  for about 2 months and I was cancer free Thank God. I got to ring the bell and was happy.Fast forward to Feb of this year. I hadn't been having any bowel movements and bad headaches Doctor wanted to do blood test and told me more blood transfusion again.I went to the ER and they admitted me because of the transfusion and suggested a colonostomy. I agreed and the next day they gave me the stuff to clean me out. All it did was make me sick and nothing. I kept on trying but they sent me home and called the doctor.The next week, drinking didn't help and put me in the hospital Three enemaes and a ct scan found a mass in my colon. I was moved to another hospital on Friday and surgery on Saturday. They found a tumor the size of a plumb, removed that, 27 lymphnodes and a pollyup that they left alone. Of course I got the bag which I hated and still hate now. 5 days in the hospital and I came home. Karla was going to be my nurse changing and emptying my bag and doctor apts.April came around and trouble happened again. I wasn't feeling good not eating or drinking. Lethargic and went to bed. Karla came by early the next morning to check on me and I was talking out of my head with one open and the other closed. She called EMS and they came and took my temp that ran 104-106. Back to the hospital, where they found I had COVID. I had no idea what was going on for 21 days until I came out of it. I had also developed a staff infection.I was sent to a rehab center home to learn to walk, talk, and dress my self all over again. I could hardly get out of bed. I ended back at the hospital for that staff infection and then back to take medicine for 25 days Then back to the home where I had PT, OCT, everyday but Saturday and Sunday until I got better enough to go home.Nothing changed PT twice a week, Karla taking care of my bag and waiting to start chemo.. Fortunately, it had been too long after surgery for it to do any good so I would not have it.It is the end of August as I sit here writing this story. I go get a colonostomy on Sept 13 (happy birthday since the 12th I turn 73) and if everything is good the bag will be removed. Checkups to continue and place everything in God's hands.I write this story in the hopes it will help other people fighting cancer giving them hope alon with their families. I use Jim Valvano's famous words that say NEVER GIVE UP DON'T EVER GIVE UP as a motto. I place my life in God's hands knowing that he will show me the way and Gail is in heaven rooting me on.I want to thank some special people who helped me thru this happening. I thank my son John and his beautiful and loving wife, Karla, who is an angel in all my families eyes for what she has done over this last 9 months almost. I thank my mother, brothers Mike (Karen). Jimmy (Nancy) and my sister Penny ( Hugh). ,my best man and friend Paul,. all the ,medical people who took care of me and other friends and family.The only words I can tell people fighting cancer is to NEVER GIVE UP and put  everything in God's hands. Don't keep your feeling hidden inside you Talk to people You will find that everything fighting cancer s family. Good luck and God bless. I also want to thank that special person in my life who is in heaven rooting me on being with me in spirit as I fight this dreaded cancer and that is Gail Kae Hargrave French Parham who has been in heaven 7 years now and helping me thru this trying times.God bless all of you"
18 years out after Stage 4 Dx,impactzone,2024-08-26T12:24:25+00:00,"Hello all,This disease is so unfair and unpredictable but I did want to throw a chance of hope out there. It is now 18 years out from the initial diagnosis. Stage 4, mets to liver and lungs. Took long time but I'm still here and doing fine. I know the long term people who I first followed meant a lot. I have no magic formula, just kept going. Lots of trying to do the right things with diet ( low carbs, no sugar) and exercise ( walking and weights in a gym). Prayers and mental health focus seemed to center me along with staying away from toxic people and complications. I wish all well and still stop in to read but do not comment. I should, but it is hard.  All my love to all.ImpactzoneChip"
New here,Ak58,2024-08-28T14:52:42+00:00,"I am 66 year male, diagnosed in April 2024 with Colorectal cancer. After an MRI & CT scan which were done soon after the surgical resection, I was given a Stage 3c and was told by cancer board that no treatment plan was needed for 6 months and a follow up is upcoming in late September. I have changed my diet since April to eat better through more fiber and less sugar. Also exercising nearly every day. My question is the wait common? Or was the believe they have removed the cancer? Any input will calm my anxiety. Am i eating and exercising right?"
New Here with severe Iron deficiency,rbarreto,2024-08-18T18:06:52+00:00,"I just found out I am severely iron deficient. I also have anemia. I have had changes in bowel habits, quite a bit of bleeding and bloating and gas. I have a colonoscopy on 9/10 but I’m freaking out in the mean time. My brother has colon cancer. Has anyone else had these symptoms but not had colon cancer?"
It's September again.,beaumontdave,2024-09-04T10:35:46+00:00,"I suddenly realized it's that month, in which was my original diagnosis, on my late wife's birthday, [Sep. 25], our Anniversary [Sep. 1], and my last CRC/liver resection [Sep. 5 or 6]. Always a muted observance, but this year is 10 years since the Labor Day Friday, of my last cancer surgery in 2014, and 17 years past the cancer treatment path began, in 2007. I counted time for so long, it feels like a luxury, or different existence, nearly forgetting the dates. I wish everyone here, gets to reach that point, where it no longer lurks in the front of one's mind, much of the time. Hi to all the veterans of the blog, who were there back when, having this place was invaluable to my mentally/emotionally coping with all I was going through. For new folk, that story is there for revue, and I hope you all beat all the odds in your recovery, as well."
Colonoscopy,bangle,2024-04-17T13:54:12+00:00,"Hello all, I had my 1st year post colon cancer.  The gastrologist took a biopsy of the surgical site, but said he didn't expect to have any bad results indicating to me it was a routine thing he did.  There were no polyps and the resection surgery I had done a year ago healed nicely his words.  Is it routine to have a biopsy done that first year colonoscopy?"
Anal Cancer,lovelyinla,2002-04-25T03:40:34+00:00,"I am currently in recurrence of anal cancer. Originally diagnosed as Stage 2 T3, I underwent chemo and radiation to resolution, with recurrence diagnosed less than 1 year after completion of treatment.Currently, I run a message board for public awareness of HPV and HPV related cancers at www.hpvinfoweb@yahoogroups.com. With over 40 members who have or have had an HPV related cancer including cervical, anal, vulva, and vaginal cancers.My current prognosis is terminal...I am Stage 4 with mets to the liver, kidneys and lymph nodes."
Enzyme levels are raised,LCBK2024,2024-08-30T09:47:39+00:00,"My dad who is in his early 80s recently had his blood tests done and had one abnormal reading - his CA Antigen 19-9 level was just over 50. Normal range is around 27. I've heard that high levels of CA 19-9 tends to be associated with cancer of the pancreas, bowel, gallbladder, bile duct, lung. Is this true?He has had no symptoms apart from the right side of his abdomen gets distended.He has been referred to further tests (CT scan) in a couple of weeks so not long to wait. But just wondering if anyone has had these high levels of this CA 19-9 Antigen and what this usually means??  Obviously and naturally, am very worried thinking the worst."
Has anyone heard from nowhere?,Wadsdan777,2024-08-23T03:26:23+00:00,"Hi all, probably to more of the oldies on the board, has anyone heard from/spoken to nowhere? I got a message on July 3rd, and see that's when he was last on.He's been a major support for me,  so I'm just getting a bit worried, hopefully tho he's just enjoying a beautiful summer !Thx"
