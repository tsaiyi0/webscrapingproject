Leg/Hip weakness/stiffness,dawn7767,2024-02-27T01:14:27+00:00,"I am 15 year post anal cancer.  The last few years I have been experiencing leg and hip weakness so bad that I can' get up off the floor when I get down to get something out of the cabinets or cleaning the floors.  Has anyone experienced or experiencing this also.  I really think it's from treatments, I had both chemo and radiation.  Any tips would be appreciated.   I have done PT yes it helped but I can't afford it on a long term basis.  It really helped when the therapist stretched my legs to areas that I cant.  I'm getting to the point that I'm having a VERY hard time getting up without anything to support (counter, chair, step stool etc)  I'm also very uneasy stepping down off a tall curb or step.  😥"
Chemo/Radiation Long Term Side Effects,dawn7767,2019-05-30T20:08:30+00:00,"I am now about 10 years post treatments.  After looking through several discussions it looks like most of us have alot of the same side effects.  
 
My first side effect started about 4 1/2 years after treatments ended and while I was on vacation.  I never had a issue until that day.  We ate lunch and was walking around seeing the sights and BAM uncontrollable diarrhea.  Now my stomach starts gurgling right before, but even then I have several accidents.  I tried taking Imodium with very little help. I am now taking Viberzi which does help except it is about $1000 per month for the precription.  I still have a few accidents and I can't pinpoint what is triggering it.  Any other suggestions?
 
I also have a mucus discharge.  Sometimes bothersome.  Any suggestions on what to help with this?
 
I know also have stiff thighs and a lower back where it is hard to bend down to pick up anything.  I am trying to stretch more and exercise more.  I just stared using a CBD safve that is helping a little. I am wondering if anyone else has had this happen also?
Any suggestions would be greatly appreicated.
 
Thank you
Dawn"
CT scan,Cheryl59,2024-10-20T22:45:15+00:00,"I saw my Oncologist a year ago, he congratulated me, he said I was done with my CT scans. But he said he was going to request one more CT scan . To see if they would approve it and The insurance approved it. Whats the guidelines when in remission, I was done with chemo and radiation on October 19,2019. Im confused I was hoping my insurance would of denied it"
Marijuana for pain?,goji,2024-01-29T20:07:25+00:00,"Has anyone had success with marijuana, gummies probably, for pain?  Luckily I live in a state where it’s legal. I’ve read that if it’s HPV related then a 3:1 ratio THC:CBD."
Proton beam therapy for anal cancer,hamservice,2024-10-18T14:13:10+00:00,Does anyone have experience with proton beam therapy instead of conventional radiation treatment for anal margin squamous cell cancer? I have just been diagnosed and am very afraid of long term effects of conventional radiation.
It has been a while,Charlie1963,2024-10-08T04:39:17+00:00,"I survived 2 rounds of chemo and weeks of daily radiation therapy.  It has been a little over a year since, if memory serves.My issue now is the near-daily pain and bleeding from fissures.  My surgeon told me I could do another ostomy; only this one would be permanent.   As bad as the temporary one was on my mental health, a permanent one is out of the question. All of my health issues have taken their toll- especially in my relationship.  I have been hurting for so long that I fear my partner is permanently distanced from me. Any suggestions on dealing with this stuff?  I am both angry and depressed.  Meds never helped, and I have recently begun therapy.Hopefully I will not be gone for so long in the future!"
Non-Ostomy... healing journey?,StarrT,2024-09-16T14:49:26+00:00,"Hey there, new here trying to learn the Forum thang…and still navigating the Survivor thing- 3yrs clear of Cancer/ treatment.If you've not had an Ostomy, does anyone else deal with mucus/ moisture leaking throut the day, leaving you feeling damp? My sphincters are both (internal 0/ external 1/3) mostly gone & scar tissue has little sensation. So anything exiting has to get away from opening b4 I can feel it.My ""OncologyTeam"" has had no advice or suggestions, other than a Full Ostomy which seems very drastic since there's no cancer to clear.So, I wear thin overnight liners during the day to keep moisture from soaking my clothes/ showing. Thankfully it has no odor. However, it still is frequent & pervasive, the leaking mucus. Have you dealt with this? Seen or heard anyone else mention it?Hoping for help/ ideas… Thanks!"
Scar tissue 6 years NED,Brendaklein,2024-07-03T18:57:53+00:00,"Yes, It hurts and is scary. My colon Doctor put me on Metamuscil in the morning and Miralax in the evening. It has helped me stay soft enough to pass normal size stool then goes to shoestring size. However, the scar tissue in on my sphincter and that's where to stool passes through. It gets inflamed and hurts now and then. I also use aquaphor everyday as well. I'm over 6 years NED now. Anyone have this problem? It there a better cream to put on it?"
Newly diagnosed,Deek1729,2024-03-27T13:36:39+00:00,"I am glad I found this site.  I was diagnosed 3/23/24. My first oncology appointment is 4/1.  From the pathology and scans it looks like I am stage 3 - scary but survivable.  Reading some of the posts I have been able to develop a list of questions for that first visit. I have a number of health issues, including MS and longstanding anemia, so I have been worried about the chemoradiation and how it will affect the other health problems.  Again, scary, but I will keep coming back to this site for tips."
long term side effects/Anyone know if my teeth problems could be related to the chemo treatment?,Psmall,2021-12-06T17:14:35+00:00,"Hello, new member here. I went through treatment 6 years ago. Had 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and mitomycin as well as 35 radiation treatments. I'm now experiencing the long term side effects of each. I've had IBS for 4 years and now have a bad ulcer in my sigmoid colon. Also experiencing tooth decay/loss/periodontal problems for the past two years. Anyone know if my teeth problems could be related to the chemo treatment? I had awful mouth sores during treatment, couldn't talk for almost 2 weeks, had to have my teeth sanded by my dentist to help with the pain. Almost got so bad they were going to put me on a feeding tube. But wondering if my current tooth decay could be related to this chemo combo. any  help is greatly appreciated!!"
Celebrating my 5 year cancer free anniversary this week!,PainInTheBum,2024-07-07T19:33:51+00:00,Having my appointment on Tuesday with oncologist.  5 years since my cancer journey began.  Not one day goes by without forgetting how grateful I'm still here.  Phew!  After going through that treatment makes you able to handle just about anything else.  Grateful for all on this forum.  I don't come here often anymore but in the beginning I was on constantly looking for any support or knowledge I could find.  Must have read every post.  It was VERY helpful to get me through.
Reduced chemo radiation clinical trial for early detected anal cancer,Maulie,2024-07-08T13:25:54+00:00,"I am wondering if anyone has been offered this option for treatment.  This is a 2 arm study, randomized selection of standard treatment or trial group.  Qualifications; T1 or T2, no lymph node or Mets detected.The purpose of this study is to determine if reduction of treatment in early stage anal cancer provides similar efficacy as standard treatment with reduction of short and long term side effects.  If selected for the trial, chemo and radiation is reduced to 20-23 days, with gy radiation reduction too.Limited results with data right now.  Early data is showing 90% clear after 6 mos. Would you go for it or is the risk too great?Maulie"

2nd opinion anal cancer,Maulie,2024-06-26T15:32:44+00:00,"I have recently been diagnosed with SCC anal cancer.  Right now, it’s stage 2, CT and MRI didn’t indicate nodes or Metz.  I had my first meeting with the Radiology Oncologist yesterday.  I can’t stand her.  No bedside manner, spoke to my husband more than me, and wouldn’t answer my questions until she was done with her schpeel (sp).  She also didn’t share what her experience was with patients with anal SCC when I asked.I want a second opinion, and and preferably a different radiology Oncologist.  I am in the process of setting up those appointments, but it will delay starting treatment - which worries me.  Has anyone sought a second opinion and did the delay change your cancer stage?  I want to keep this out of my lymph nodes and am concerned the delay will cause more harm than good.Thoughts and advice?Thank you - Maudie"

High resolution ultrasound anoscopy anal cancer,Beeger,2024-04-27T12:58:39+00:00,"Greetings Everyone,
Hope this finds everyone doing well and thriving. I am post anal cancer July 2021 post chemo radiation, have been getting manual rectal exams with anoscopy in the clinic now scheduled for High resolution anoscopy under the ultrasound and scope in the clinic that takes a more extensive look and possible biopsies if needed in the exam room without sedation and I am petrified. Is this painful? Should I request a Valium or demand it under sedation? Thoughts and advice is welcomed. 
Thank you for your feedback.

Choosing where to get treatment,Deek1729,2024-04-03T07:27:20+00:00,"So it's getting real. Yesterday I met with the medical oncologist, today I meet the radiation oncologist.  As I had thought, it is a stage 3 cancer.  Yesterday I decided to get a second opinion next week.  I am fortunate to have easy access to two academic medical centers. While the diagnosis won't change, and I doubt the treatment plans will differ, I find myself most concerned about the support teams.  I want to make sure that I will have help with scheduling, quick access when I have serious side effects, etc."
Port removal,foxa14,2024-02-28T19:51:49+00:00,"So I think I’m gonna have to get my port removed but not because the cancer has ended…(it’s just stable for now) I had to have portagram this morning and when they tried to flush with saline, I got hit with a pocket of air in my neck it felt like a horse kicked me! And they were only able to get 1ml in! So I go in for the x ray and they were only able to put in 6 ml of contrast in and it was VERY painful!! Catheter isn’t functioning properly and the contrast was leaking through all my tissues and such in my neck. Very painful! Anyway, any advice on how to prep for this procedure? I sweat bullets at the thought of needles."
Did your anal cancer affect vaginal opening,lge,2023-12-10T16:24:21+00:00,"This question is for females I was recently diagnosed with anal cancer when I met with 2nd group Dr for 2nd opinion I mention that the vaginal opening is itching as much as anus, is this common for anal cancer? He referred me to gynecologist to be checked."
Advice and Help,CanadaNorth,2024-01-31T03:36:05+00:00,"My mom (75 Years old) went for a colonoscopy in March, 2023. During her colonoscopy, the surgeon indicated that he had a hard time with the colonoscopy because of a blockage. He deemed it suspicious and informed my mom that his first thought was Anal Cancer. He indicated that it was treatable and curable. My mom prior to her diagnosis was an avid 3-4 mile/day Walker and healthy eater.My mom subsequently went for a CT Scan and went to the Cancer Center to begin radiation for her Anal Cancer in April, 2023. The Radiologist/Onocologist was surprised when he saw the CT scan as it appeared that the Anal Cancer had metastasized and spread to her lymph nodes and liver with 2-3 spots in each location. My mom then went for an MRI and where it was verified as well. This new development meant that mom would start Chemotherapy treatment right away. My mom has experienced Chemotherapy before as she battled Cervical cancer in 1975 and Breast Cancer in 2003 where it was discovered that she had the BRKA Gene.Mom began her Carboplatin-paclitaxel regiment in May, 2023, with 3 weeks on Chemotherapy and then 1 week break with the Cycle to begin again for another 3 weeks with 1 week off. This continued but my mom was having severe fecal incontinencd and we brought this up with her local doctors but they assured us it was because of her cancer. At the end of June, 2023, we brought mom to the ER as she was severely disdained around her abdomen. The doctor in the ER determined that there was a large blockage in her rectum and colon that was putting pressure on her Bladder. We also notified him of the fecal incontinence and discomfort mom was having from her anus as we were told the pain was the tumour in her anus. After further examination from the ER doctor noticed that it was a large abscess near my mom’s anus and that it needed to be drained. It was subsequently drained and after many attempts to empty her bowels the Surgeon notified us that a fistula had formed because of the fecal blockage in her rectum and colon.In order to allow the fistula to heal a Double Barrel Colostomy was performed. The surgeon told us that he tried to remove as much of the fecal mass and fecal impaction that had been in there for what he determined to be many months. He said that it was hard as a rock and the size of a grapefruit. She also developed a fistula near her stoma.Mom was in hospital for over a month, but was able to continue her Chemotherapy treatment 1 week after surgery. Before being discharged after 1 month in the hospital, the doctors had completed several CT Scans which showed that the lesions on the liver and lymph nodes were gone and that the tumour had shrunk considerably.The hospital stay greatly affected my mom as she had to learn how to walk again and regain her mobility (she is still struggling but walking a lot better now). After her MRI in August, 2023 her onocologist indicated that the Cancer Lesions on the liver and lymph nodes were gone and that the tumour was gone and that there was no evidence of any cancer. We were elated! He wanted to continue another 6 Chemotherapy treatments just to make sure that it removed any further cancer cells.After her last treatment in October, 2023 (18 treatments total) and subsequent CT & MRI scan, the same information was shared…no cancer visible anywhere! Again we were in such disbelief and elated. In November, 2023 mom had some internal bleeding which was a tear in her colostomy. That healed through some blood transfusions and bringing up her Blood Levels. She had 4 blood transfusions over the course of her Chemotherapy treatment. The doctor did notice that she had a minor lung infection therefore was prescribed antibiotics and sent home. Mom then had 2 Iron Transfusions to help with increasing her blood levels and then had a CT Scan in December to see if the minor lung infection had cleared up, which it did, however they noticed 2-3 lesions on the liver. Our onocologist sent mom for  an MRI at the beginning of January, 2024. We received the results of the MRI indicating that there were 5-6 new lesions with the largest being 12 mm and smaller. Our onocologist indicated that he wanted to start mom on Immunotherapy (Opdivo - Nivolumab) but we needed to sign some information. 2 days after we received a call indicating that this immunotherapy was not covered by our Province in Canada or their medical plan for my moms type of cancer and that we would have to find alternate payment options. However things have changed. We were told by our onocologist that (Opdivo - Nivolumab) was not permitted for treating my moms cancer and that he was now applying for Keytruda (pembrolizumab) to be the immunotherapy for mom ONLY if her biopsy tests positive for the dMMR gene. If she doesn’t have the gene then the only other option would be to:begin Chemotherapy again with either a new regimen or continue with her old regimen (we are not sue if our mom can handle this)stop treatment all together So we need some advice.Are there any immunotherapy treatments that would work for my mom?I have heard about low dose chemotherapy…is this possible?We need some help."
POST RADIATION PROBLEMS HIP AND PELVIC BONE DAMAGE,lizgino,2013-04-17T09:39:47+00:00,"Is anyone dealing with this?  I was diagnosed in April 2011 and had my treatments (chemo and radiation) through May and June.  I was stage III so I had pretty intense radiation, including pinpoint to specific lymph nodes that were affected.
I have extreme low back pain, spasms (he says probably related to muscles trying to support joints), my hips are tight and always sore.  The pain is constant, dull and REALLY uncomfortable.   He examed me no signs of returning cancer in anal area, but did CT Scan to clear rectum and lymph nodes.
Just wondering if anyone required hip replacements down the road, or had problems walking, etc.  I'm going to begin Les Mill's flow class (yoga, stretching, ti chi etc to work on flexibility).
MD says not much can be done, and that  radiation side effects will continue.  Any guidance will help! Thanks!"

Typical protocol 27 Radiation treatments, 2 Mito and 5 Xeloda M-F.  I am wondering if there is anyone else who also has MS? I take a monthly infusion drug Tysabri which is an immunomodulator.

Getting BACK to living!!!!,drpearl,2023-07-02T18:33:36+00:00,"Hi all, just checking in. I am one year from my diagnosis now. My treatments ended in Sept 2022. I had a few really dark months and was unable to shake the fear of incontinece. My urgency kept me home and afraid to do much. It was creating more anxiety and messing up my household moral. None of us were able to work. Some on disability, some had run out. We were a mess!!!I had a breakdown in March with my surgeon and nurse navigator. I had another down day in April with my Onc. He called my PCP and they started me on Wellbutrin. It took several days, but I STARTED TO HAVE CLEARER THINKING. I began to focus on my nutrition and my body became less achy and I felt able to move better, less joint pain. I did 8 weeks of physical therapy for my hips after radiation, and now I am in Pelvic floor theraphy. I now look for options instead of excuses. Now it is July again and I am feeling strong, I am running and training for the 2023 Chicago Marathon. I am reclaiming my power!I thought my life was over, feeling doomed to being a sad housebound middle aged lady who had lost all of her nest egg to cancer. Well, I am starting a new business and a part-time job as well. I have started to look for solutions that work for me, instead of searching for justification for my short-comings. I know how easy it can be to just stop trying because this horrific uncomfortable to talk about cancer paused my life for a while. But I am here to say NO MORE!!! Cancer had enough of my time and energy, I vow to continue to do better to reclaim my power and live my life.LIFE is OUT there!!! GO get it!!!"
10 years and grateful,sandysp,2021-08-31T00:57:48+00:00,"Hi, 
I used to be on this board every day. It was a lifeline. I wsa very frightened and hurting. Anal Cancer put me through a lot too. But I am happy to say even though my cancer was late stage, we  beat it back with the protocol treatment, chemo and radiation, simultaneously. For me it was brutal. I am alergic to Sulfa and so they could not give me the Sulfadine ointment and I had to make do throughout with just Aquaphor for the radiation burns. 
Now, it is such a distant memory. It has been ten years. My last treatment was August 18, 2011.  Having anal cancer taught me a lot about myself and all the people who work in cancer treatment and rehabilitation. i am very grateful. Push through it. It is worth it.
i discovered i have Lymphodema and have faced and managed it successfully.Also, If you have lymphadema as a result of the cancer invading your lymph nodes, disabling them, learning to take care of it is not hard. I now feel everyone would benefit from the self care I give myself to assist my lymphatic system. That I had it and it was discovered, was at first depressing and daunting,. But I am pleased to say, so far, it's not bad at all to do what it takes to manage it..The benefits far outweigh theh challenges.
Hang in there and keep supporting each other. The interactions on This board with survivors taught me a lot and gave me a lot of support and hope when I needed it most.
God bless you.Hang in there.

Itchy Itchy Itchy !

Scans after Radiation and Chemo,Tamt,2023-11-29T17:34:39+00:00,"Hi everyone I’m new here and I’m just looking for a bit of clarification my current experiences with Anal cancer treatment stage 2.I finished my last radiation treatment 4 months ago, had a scope done by the surgeon and he claimed tumour was gone “just a scar” this was excellent news. And he doesn’t want to see me for a year.Oncologist has ordered CT scan and PET scan anyway even after this news (internally I was freaking out) CT showed some residual small mass that could be scar tissue as I had two surgeries, 2 infections and 30 radiation treatments in that area as well my original tumour was very large.PET is tomorrow and I’m now on this roller coaster because surgeon told me to go home and celebrate but these scans have me panicking and I thought I was currently ok.any insight would be great, I understand these are routine scans but how often does scar tissue show up in the treated area? My assumption is quite often but I’m not a physician. Thank you in advance."
Pros and Cons of traveling far away for treatment,EmilySB,2024-01-17T20:23:16+00:00,"Hi -I don't have an official anal cancer dx yet,  my biopsy is Friday, but my Dr. said it is likely cancer from the office exam he did last week.  I have been having symptoms for a long time, but they have gotten worse (a lot of pain and bleeding) for about a month which lead me to the CR surgeon.  I am trying to do all my research so if/when the dx comes I can be prepared and not overwhelmed. I live in a mid-sized town with a local hospital that actually doesn't have the best reputation and is going through some problems right now, including be sanctioned by the state for some issues. There is one mid size oncologist practice center here.  One oncologist in that practice lists anal cancer as a ""specialty"".  The closest large university cancer centers are 2-3 hours from here (Duke and Wake Forrest).  I am a 47 yo mom with a 12 yo daughter and caring/supportive husband.    We have already decided that if it's cancer, then I am going to take a leave from work for maybe even up to 6 months, so we will take a hit on our income, but we will be ok.  But it would be a major stretch for us to afford a place to stay while I am getting treatment, but we could probably swing it.   I would also be alone, with no support.  My husband owns his own business and couldn't leave with me, plus he would need to be home for our daughter.  They could maybe come a few weekends to visit.  I can't imagine being alone going through this.  My mom could potentially come for some, but my dad needs care for an upcoming surgery, so she could maybe be with me for 1-2 weeks.  It sounds like the treatment for AC is pretty standard.  Is it worth it to consider a major cancer center/university treatment?  What can they offer that my local doctors can't.  This is assuming stage 1-2/3.  If stage 3/4, than I understand a larger cancer center would be the best way to go.Thank you for any insight."
